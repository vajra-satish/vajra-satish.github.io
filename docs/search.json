    "text": "Abstract: The informal economy is a common feature of developing countries and Nepal is no exception to it. Addressing the issue of heterogeneity is imperative to understanding informal enterprises, as one policy solution that works for some informal enterprises might not work for other informal enterprises. In a similar vein, the impact of the Covid-19 on informal enterprises is also an important issue that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the workers in the informal economy face rights, social protection, and representational deficits. Literature suggests three important policy implications to deal with informality: reduction of tax rates and entry costs, strict law enforcement, and improved business environment. In essence, it is crucial to understand if these policy implications are applicable in the context of Nepal. In this study, primary and secondary sources of data have been used. Inferential statistical analysis is done from the World Bank Enterprise Survey data and the World Bank Informal Survey data to make generalizations about the population of informal enterprises in Nepal. Likewise, qualitative content analysis is done from the personal interview survey data to understand enterprises from a closer perspective. The research provides some important insights on informality in the context of Nepal: a) registration depends upon important factors such as the age of the owner, sales, market speculation, business maturity, level of law enforcement, business environment, strategic behavior of competitors, and market conditions, b) the associated costs of registration is higher than its benefits, c) informal enterprises are flexible and they tend to depend on informal sources of finance, d) informal enterprises are vulnerable to external shocks like the Covid-19 pandemic. The research concludes on the need to adopt a synergistic policy approach, whereby emphasis should be laid on building a centralized database for informal workers, better access to finance, distinguished policy options for informal enterprises, information campaigns on registration procedures and benefits to registration, long-term policy on economic growth and accessible education, flexible and market-oriented training programs, identification of intermediaries, working through intermediaries to provide selective benefits and a mechanism to provide a safety net for informal workers and own-account informal workers."

    "text": "Introduction to power calculations\nPower calculations play a critical role in determining the number of people or households to include in a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Further, statistical tests are prone to type 1 and type 2 errors. We can reduce the probability of such errors by increasing the sample size. However, in practice, sample size is determined by the amount of resources at hand since there is a trade off between the sample size and the cost of data collection.\nSpillovers in RCTs are also a cause of concern for researchers. As a result, we might also use clusters in RCT to tackle spillovers effects. However, clustering often requires a larger sample size as we are stratifying the sample into different clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClustered RCTs are more prone to type 1 and type 2 errors than an unclustered RCT design with the same number of individuals or households. The way we assign individuals to different experimental groups can also reduce the incidence of type 1 and type 2 errors. For instance, using characteristics such as gender to stratify the randomization.\n\n\nType 1 and type 2 errors\nWhen conducting RCTs, we are guided by the principle of conservatism. We do not want to promote costly policy changes without evidence. We stack the deck against ourselves by making an assumption that there is no impact made by the intervention. Given this assumption, we check whether our data is consistent with this assumption, which is called the null hypothesis. It is denoted by \\(H_0\\). While making inference, we are prone to these two types of errors which are shown below.\n\nType 1 and type 2 errors\n\nTest Statistic\n\\(H_0=T\\)\n\\(H_0=F\\)\n\n\n\n\\(t&lt;=2\\)\nCorrect Inference\nType 2 error\n\n\n\\(t&gt;=2\\)\nType 1 error\nCorrect inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere, the test statistic measures the difference in average outcomes between the treatment and control group as a result of the intervention. Type 1 error occurs when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when it is actually true. Type 2 error occurs when we fail to reject the \\(H_0\\) when it is actually false.\n\n\nStatistical power\nBy understanding the type 1 and type 2 errors, we can calibrate the power of a statistical test. Power of a statistical test is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when it is false. In general, it is the likelihood of not making a type 2 error. \\[Power (\\kappa): 0&lt;\\kappa&lt;1\\]\nThe level of significance determines how conservative or cautious we want to be in jumping to conclusion about the effectiveness of an intervention. The significance level determines the chance of making type 1 error. It is also referred as the size of a test denoted by \\(\\alpha\\). We would like to make sure we reject \\(H_0\\) when there is an effect. More power means we have a better chance to do so.\nWhat determines power?\n\nEffect size (\\(\\beta\\)): When running a RCT, the effect size is the difference between the average outcome of the control and treatment group. A large effect size increases the power of a statistical test.\n\nSample size (\\(n\\)): Increasing the sample size increases the power of a statistical test. Suppose we have an outcome variable \\(X\\). Variance of the estimated difference in means is related to the variance of underlying variable \\(X\\) and the sample size. As sample size increases, the variance of the estimated difference in means reduces thereby increasing power. A reduction in variance of \\(X\\) also reduces the variance of the estimated difference in means (control and treatment group).\n\nFor instance, in evaluating an education project, we can work with sample of individuals whose outcomes we expect to be relatively homogeneous. To do so, we can focus on kids in a single grade of primary school or work with a narrow age range instead of working with children in all grades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you gain in terms of power you lose in terms of external validity.\n\n\n\nThe power formula\nWhen we talk about power (\\(\\kappa\\)), we need to consider these elements:\n\nSize of a test: \\(\\alpha\\)\n\nEffect size: \\(\\beta\\) (\\(b\\) is the estimated treatment effect from the sample: \\(\\bar{X_T}-\\bar{X_C}\\), where T and C corresponds to treatment and control group)\nVariance of the underlying outcome data: \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\nSample size: \\(n\\)\n\n\nIn practice, we fix \\(\\alpha\\), \\(n\\) and \\(\\kappa\\) given any \\(\\sigma^2\\) and reduce the five way relationship into a two way relationship between \\(\\beta\\) and \\(n\\). Doing so, we can either input an expected effect size (\\(\\beta\\)) to get the sample size (\\(n\\)) or input sample size (\\(n\\)) to get a minimum detectable effect size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe minimum detectable effect size is the smallest effect that can be detected with a given probability by a statistical test at a certain significance level.\n\n\nThe power formula for a sample split into two groups in equal proportion in treatment and control group is: \\[\\beta=2*(z_{1-\\kappa}+z_{\\alpha/2})*\\sigma/\\sqrt n\\] Dividing both sides by \\(\\sigma\\), we get: \\[\\beta/\\sigma=2*(z_{1-\\kappa}+z_{\\alpha/2})*1/\\sqrt n\\] Here, \\(\\beta/\\sigma\\) is the minimum detectable effect size for a sample split into two groups in equal proportion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVisit this site to know more about the power formula.\n\n\nWe can invert the power formula to estimate the sample size required for a given minimum detectable effect. The formula is for two groups split into equal proportions.\n\\[n=4*(z_{1-\\kappa}+z_{\\alpha/2})^2*(\\sigma/\\beta)^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting power and minimum detectable effect\n\n\n\nResearchers usually use a power size of 0.8 or higher. In many situations the minimum detectable effect is based on policy objectives or benchmark values.\n\n\nHere, we assume that the underlying variable follows a normal distribution with a known variance. But in practice, such assumption do not hold. In such cases we use a modified version of the power formula using the t statistic.\n\\[\\beta=2*(t_{1-\\kappa}+t_{\\alpha/2})*S/\\sqrt n\\]\nwhere,\n\nt statistic corresponds to the critical values of t distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom.\nS is the square root of the estimated sample variance.\n\n\nTargeting a smaller and smaller effect size results in a sample size that rises at a steeper and steeper rate. Here, \\(1-\\beta\\) corresponds to the power of a test.\nReferences\nImpact evaluation Methods with Applications in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, World Bank"

    "text": "Throughout history, change has been difficult. Breaking the shackles of normalcy and going against the well-established norm has always been a continuous struggle. Despite the presence of these antecedent conditions in history, our culture, values, and norms have continuously evolved. We have to agree that change is difficult but it is a process of making things better, not for oneself but for the betterment of the society in itself. In Adam Smithâ€™s words, the progress of society has been made by the ingenuity of philosophers or people of speculation. In other words, change is necessary for the amelioration of human conditions and is often attributed to those who observe and speculate. However, there have been instances in history where change has deteriorated the status quo and made things worse off rather than better off. Why is it so? This again leads to the question of whether change is good or bad. We will delve into these aspects in the following sections.\nUnderstanding Individuals\nBefore understanding the culture of change, we need to understand the individuals who will bring or will be affected by the change. Borrowing from economics, the very fundamental notion of individuals is driven by wants, desires, and choices based on rationality. Although, I do not agree on rationality as sometimes we tend to make irrational decisions based on feelings and instinctsâ€¦\nPlease visit the Daayitwa website to read the full article."
