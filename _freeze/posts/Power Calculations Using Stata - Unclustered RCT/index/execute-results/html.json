Suppose we want to calculate the sample size required for a randomized control trial for a program intervention. The team plans to assign equal number of people to the treatment and control group.  \n\n\n::: {.cell engine.path='C:/Stata15/Stata-64.exe'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\npower twomeans 0 0.01\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\n. power twomeans 0 0.01\n\nPerforming iteration Estimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test\nt test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: m2 = m1  versus  Ha: m2 != m1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.8000\n        delta =    0.0100\n           m1 =    0.0000\n           m2 =    0.0100\n           sd =    1.0000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =   313,958\n  N per group =   156,979\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
