# Introduction to power calculations

Power calculations play a critical role in determining the number of people or households to include in a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Statistical tests are prone to type 1 and type 2 errors. We can reduce the probability of such errors by increasing the sample size. However, in practice, sample size is determined by the amount of resources at hand. There is a trade off between the sample size and the cost of data collection. We might also use clusters in RCT to tackle treatment spillovers.

::: callout-note
Clustered RCTs are more prone to type 1 and type 2 errors than an unclustered RCT design with the same number of individuals or households. The way we assign individuals to different experimental groups can also reduce the incidence of type 1 and type 2 errors. For instance, using characteristics such as gender to stratify the randomization.

# Type 1 and Type 2 errors

When conducting RCTs, we are guided by the principle of conservatism. We do not want to promote costly policy changes without evidence. We stack the deck against ourselves by making an assumption that there is no impact. Given this assumption, we check whether our data is consistent with this assumption.This is the assumption that we test, which is called the null hypothesis denoted by $H_0$.
