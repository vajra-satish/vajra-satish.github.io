# How to make comparisons between treatment and control group?

While measuring impact of an intervention or program, we randomly assign individuals to treatment and control groups and compare the average outcome in each group. In general, we ask if the outcomes are different between the groups. 

Researchers use regression analysis to report the results of a RCT in scientific journals or reports.

Regression equation: $y_i= \alpha + \beta T_i + \epsilon_i$. Here, the outcome variable is denoted by $y$, error term is deonted by $\epsilon_i$, and treatment variable is denoted by $T_i$. If an individual is assigned to the treatment group, $T = 1$, otherwise $T = 0$.

A regression not just allows us to quantify the relationship between the treatment and outcome variable but also quantify the associations between outcomes and other variables. When we introduce other variables, we say that we are controlling for other factors. 

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \gamma_1 Income_i + \gamma_2 Education_i + ... $$

Here, we are controlling for income and education in regression equation. Introducing such controls may or may not be useful (a separate blog on control variables will be uploaded later).  

# How to measure the average impact of an intervention?

To measure the average impact of an intervention, we estimate the average outcome in the treatment group, $\bar y (T=1)$, and compare it with the average outcome in the control group, $\bar y (T=0)$. 

##### Computing average outcome for the control group and treatment group

Using the regression equation, lets compute the average outcome for the treatment and control group. For the treatment group, the treatment variable will take on the value of one. 

$$ \bar y(1) = \alpha + \beta * 1 = \alpha + \beta $$
The average outcome of the treatment group is the sum of coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$

For the control group, the treatment variable will take on the value of zero. 

$$\bar y(0) = \alpha + \beta * 0 = \alpha$$

The average outcome of the control group is $\alpha$, which is also the intercept term. 

We can calculate the average impact of an intervention by calculating the different in average outcome between the treatment and control group. 

$$\bar y(1) - \bar y(0) = \alpha + \beta -\alpha = \beta$$

In a regression equation, the coefficient $\beta$ gives an estimate of the average impact of an intervention.
