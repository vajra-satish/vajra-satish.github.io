In this section, we calculate the power for individually randomized experiments. Suppose we want to calculate the sample size required for a randomized control trial(RCT) for a program intervention, where equal number of people are assigned to the treatment and control groups. We fix a test size ($\alpha$) of 0.5 to calculate the sample size required to detect a 0.1 standard deviation effect size with 80% power. We use a standard deviation value of 1.

## Power Calculations

To know more about the theoretical approach to power calculations, check my previous blog [here](https://vajra-satish.github.io/blogs/Power%20Calculations%20in%20RCT%20-%20Without%20Clusters%20(Theory)/)

##### Execution in R

We use the **pwr** package in R to calculate the sample size for individually randomized experiments. We use the **pwr.t.test()** function with arguments n, d, sig.level, power, and type. The default standard deviation value is 1 so we do not need to specify it. A brief description of the arguments is given below:

| Arguments  | Description  |
|--------|--------|
| n  | Number of observations (per sample) |
| d   | Effect size   |
| sig.level | Significance level (Type I error probability) |
|power | Type of t test |

To run the **pwr.t.test()** funcntion we need to install the *pwr* package with the install.packages command. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wTcDqJWSzA) to learn how to install packages in R. 

To test a 0.1 standard deviation effect size with standard deviation of 1, we set the minimum detectable effect to 0.1. The *power.t.test()* will give the sample size required to detect 0.1 standard deviation effect size, which is the difference between the treatment and control mean.  

```{r}
# Load the pwr package
library(pwr)
# Run the pwr.t.test function
pwr.t.test(n = NULL, 
           d = 0.1,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           power = 0.8,
           type = "two.sample")
```

```{stata, engine.path="C:/Stata15/Stata-64.exe"}
power twomeans 0 0.01
```
