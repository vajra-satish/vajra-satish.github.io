In this section,, we calculate the power for individually randomized experiments. Suppose we want to calculate the sample size required for a randomized control trial for a program intervention. The team plans to assign equal number of people to the treatment and control group.  

```
. power twomeans 23.7 20.3, sd(17)

Performing iteration ...

Estimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test
t test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd
Ho: m2 = m1  versus  Ha: m2 != m1

Study parameters:

        alpha =    0.0500
        power =    0.8000
        delta =   -3.4000
           m1 =   23.7000
           m2 =   20.3000
           sd =   17.0000

Estimated sample sizes:

            N =       788
  N per group =       394

. dis -3.4/17

        delta =   -0.2000

           m2 =   -0.2000
           sd =    1.0000
