In this section, we calculate the power for individually randomized experiments. Suppose we want to calculate the sample size required for a randomized control trial for a program intervention, where equal number of people are assigned to the treatment and control groups. We fix a test size ($\alpha$) of 0.5 to calculate the sample size required to detect a 0.1 standard deviation effect size with 80% power. We use a standard deviation value of 1.
