In this section,, we calculate the power for individually randomized experiments. Suppose we want to calculate the sample size required for a randomized control trial for a program intervention. The team plans to assign equal number of people to the treatment and control group.  

```{stata, engine.path="C:/Stata15/Stata-64.exe"}
power twomeans 0 0.01
```
